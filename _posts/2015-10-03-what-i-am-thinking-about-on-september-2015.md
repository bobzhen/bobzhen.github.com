  It has been a while, that I am not blogging on this website, neither on my personal e-commerce website. Nobody knows why.
</p>

<p>
  On first part of September 2015, I was travelling, but literally, I am a bad traveller. From Shenzhen to Beijing, then from Beijing down to mid-east China, back to Shenzhen after 10 days. I enjoy travelling, especially travelling by train. I was asked why I love this type of trip on interview, I said something, but I couldn't remember it, maybe I think the meaning of being travelling with train is being travelling with train, that's all.

  I started my new job, after backing to the people-fulfilled, traffic-jammed city, Shenzhen. I do not like Shenzhen too much, but why I am staying here? Maybe the opportunities? The equality of life-style level? The youngest city in China? I am not a social guy, I perfer staying at home rather than get drunk with friends, and I perfer simple. When people involved, things become complicated as we couldn't image.

  When autumn is coming, I stop reading, technically. Time after work is taken by endless extra-works, and I am getting procrastinated on reading books. The boooooooooooks I have brought are stacking on my shelf, and I want to buy more. That sucks.

  I consider to highlight this September as a new check point.

  Sorry, I don't want to check any typographical or grammatical error, I am glad if you could be able to read until now. Thanks.
