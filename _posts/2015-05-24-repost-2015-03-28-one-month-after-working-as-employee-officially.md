<p>
  The contract begins on March 02 2015, but I gave 3 duty days for one period of adaption.
</p>
<p>
  Everything goes well at the beginning, but once dev job assigned and needed to be delivered into staging
  next day, I was shocked and scared: I was afraid of being uncapable of developping such backend job in one
  day, even I got one peer here for helping me; With my prior experience, I have never done one assigned mission
  in one day.
</p>
<p>
  After all, I could not eventually get things done in 8 hours. I failed it on time but five days later. And the day
  I submitted all code, I got accusations from supervisor in the weekly meeting.
</p>
<p>
  I could not blame anyone but myself, the verbe 'blame' may be radical. I have had reflect on myself, as a junior developer,
  I am not very familiar with whole working processes and the big-picture of company system. That all should be prepared well before
  I dived into development. One other cons is I need to practice more on Ruby and Rails, being understanding their mechanisms.
</p>
<p>
  Load the ammo, aim the traget, and pull the trigger.
</p>
<p>
  Happy coding.
