    I was playing badminton tonight, my arms are very painful. So I decided to just put some notes or key words about Russ Olsen's keynote.
  </p>
  <p>
    I forgot to mention that Russ Olsen's keynote was the closing keynote of <i>keep ruby wired 2014</i>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Here are some notes I have taken and learnt from his speech.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Little thing can kill you</i>--conclusion from Apollo Program, about the Rocket and Spaceship.</li>
    <li><i>Get every single detail right!!!</i></li>
    <li><i>Trust, it's the key to overcome problems, also the leadership</i></li>
    <li><i>We choose to go to the moon, not because it's easy, but because it's hard.--John F. Kennedy</i>. So we need to go to something hard.</li>
    <li><i>To inspire others</i></li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Last, "when you do something technically cool, that may make you rich, but it's second affairs, the important is it makes people believe, wave people believe, make people believe the possibilities and the future.".
  </p>

  <p>
    Bon courage, be different and make others' life better.

  <h3>2015-01-05.</h3>
  <p>After having watched Russ Olsen's keynote, I watched <a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">DHH</a>'s keynote on Railsconf 2014 @Chicago today</p>
  <p>
    Here is some snippets from his speech:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>If you can't measure something, you can't understant it; if you can't understand it, you can't control it; if you can't control it, you can't improve it---<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming">W. Edwards Deming</a></li>
    <li>About Clarity in software development: "I know it when I see it"---Justice Stewart 1964</li>
    <li>About Readability: "Any code you have done is draft"</li>
    <li>DHH also talked about his opinions on TDD. I have little experience on TDD.</li>
    <li>Instead of being a software developer, DHH thinks that it's better to be a Software Writer</li>
    <li>Last, "Write software well"---DHH</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Some improvements done today:
  </p>
  <p>
    1) I am using <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>, as wonderful as Sublime Text 2, a text editor with great compatibilities with Github(which feature I have not tested yet, I just guess, lol) created by Github, for editing this article;
  </p>
  <p>
    2) I am starting to read the source code of <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails">Rails</a>, In the near future, I believe there will be some articles about my road to read rails' source code.
  </p>

  <p>
    Good night.
