    <h3>2015-01-04.</h3>

	<p>The passing 3 days were a historical day for me.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>I am able to run at least 5 km with non-stop break. Precisely, it was 5.3 km.</li>
		<li>I have one new year resolution for year 2015.</li>
		<li>I am writing this blog.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>This should be a good beginning for 2015.</p>
	<hr/>
	<p>Tonight, I have watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=50ExWDcim5I">The closing keynote</a> of "Keep Ruby Wired 2014" held by <a href="http://russolsen.com/">Russ Olsen</a>, author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321584104/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321584104&linkCode=as2&tag=eloqruby-20">Eloquent Ruby</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321490452/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321490452&linkCode=as2&tag=eloqruby-20">Design Patterns in Ruby</a>. He presented us one story about the Apollo Project in 1960s, during the Cold War.</p>
	<p>The Apollo Project was an arbitrary project, luanched by the US government, they want to win the Ruassains after the Ruassains had successfully sent a spaceship with one astronaut Yuri Gagarine (there are so many roads in France named Rue Yuri Gagarin) to the space.</p>
	<p>Mr. Olsen talks about many rarely knowns by people. The engineers worked for the Apollo Project from scratch, they built one series of testing spaceship called Ranger, and this stuff was used to test the accessibility for reaching the moon. They had totally luanched seven(?) Rangers</p>
	<p>In the mean time of testing spaceship, NASA trained their astronauts, one of them, of cause you know him and you must do know him, Neil Armstrong, was selected for this unknown trip to the moon. With Neil Armstrong, there are two more astronauts, Michael Collins, and Buzz Aldrin. As well as we know, two of them have luckily stepped one the surface of moon, and the third one, has to stay inside the operation room and controls the machine, the most suckest job in the world.</p>
	<p>After having countless defficulities, the Apollo 11 has landed on the moon and two of the spaceship's crew stepped on the moon. Finally, they were back to earth safe and sound.</p>

	<p>Mr. Olsen has spent 3/5 time of his keynote talking about the Apollo Program, I was very confusing about it, why he spends so many precious time talking about one irrelevant story? He is famous of his contribution of working on ruby and wrote two books? </p>

	<p>It's 00:07 of the fifth jan 2015, it's time for bed. I will continue tomorrow.</p>
