    <h3>2015-01-14, I have signed my first job contract today, with three-month probation</h3>

  <p>
    I have got one interview at a startup, ten people. I am not very familiar with what they are doing, which is internet-based third-party insurance business, but I am interesting in which kind of tech they are using -- Ruby On Rails.
  </p>

  <p>
    From the beginning of 2014, I started learing Ruby after by being inspired by one of my friend in USA, who switched from traditionnal programming language, like Java, to Ruby/ROR two years ago, I guess. One day, he told me to have a try on Ruby, he was given to Ruby.
  </p>

  <p>
    Then I have had a try on Ruby. In fact, I don't like much those scripting language, like Javascript, cause they are so dynamic and none of my friends using them. But until I typed "puts ‘hello world’", I realized that Ruby is an amazing language, and this language is the one that worth to devote myself to it.
  </p>

  <p>
    I watched one serie of ruby-teaching video course, about 2 hours, I could be able to write a simple ruby class, to use sereval methods, and irb. I fell into love with Ruby.
  </p>

  <p>
    <b><i>So how to make a soilder to be a general? Send him into warfare. </i></b>
  </p>

  <p>
    After having learing 2 hours ruby and my basic knowlodge about OO, I sent my resumé to a startup in Guangzhou, China. There was only few words related to the job description (Rails Intern Position) like "I am learing ruby/ruby on rails" on my resumé, the rest of it contains my past experience using Java, C#, ASP.NET, etc. But eventually, I got a video interview, I was in France, the recruiter was in China.
  </p>

  <p>
    I got four or five days for reviewing (actually learing) Ruby On Rails, so I practiced some basic Rails techniques, generate a new project, create a model, migrate the database, map the relationship between models, that's all.
  </p>

  <p>
    The interview was 8 a.m. on Monday in Paris, I got up earlier, reviewed some note, and been waiting for the recruiter with patience. I had my self-intro part, and answered some background questions and some technical questions about Ruby and OO, I got stuck when the recruiter asking me what's a socket, I couldn't answer it. She also asked me why I am learing Ruby and why I want back to Guangzhou.
  </p>

  <p>
    After the video interview ended, I though it was over (not meaning I could not get the internship), her boss called me via QQ (one popular IM in China) unexpectedly. He asked me some non-technique question, for example, source control management, linux or windows, etc. He thought it's very hard to switch from Java (I was using java at that time) to Ruby because of the difference of philosophy behind them. I could not be agree with him.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, the fonder agreed to give me this internship. But I did not go there then, cause the beginning time was not match.
  </p>

  <p>
    This is my early story with Ruby.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am very happy to have my first job as a Rails/full-stack developer.
