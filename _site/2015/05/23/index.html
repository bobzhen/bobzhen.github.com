  <h3>2015-05-23, Let's talk about recruitment, then screw it.</h3>


  <p>
    The contract begins on March 02 2015, but I gave 3 duty days for one period of adaption.
  </p>
  <p>
    Everything goes well at the beginning, but once dev job assigned and needed to be delivered into staging
    next day, I was shocked and scared: I was afraid of being uncapable of developping such backend job in one
    day, even I got one peer here for helping me; With my prior experience, I have never done one assigned mission
    in one day.
  </p>
  <p>
    After all, I could not eventually get things done in 8 hours. I failed it on time but five days later. And the day
    I submitted all code, I got accusations from supervisor in the weekly meeting.
  </p>
  <p>
    I could not blame anyone but myself, the verbe 'blame' may be radical. I have had reflect on myself, as a junior developer,
    I am not very familiar with whole working processes and the big-picture of company system. That all should be prepared well before
    I dived into development. One other cons is I need to practice more on Ruby and Rails, being understanding their mechanisms.
  </p>
  <p>
    Load the ammo, aim the traget, and pull the trigger.
  </p>
  <p>
    Happy coding.
